## Model Card

I am an incoming Research Scientist affiliated with [GEAR](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/gear/) at [NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/), working with [Joel Jang](https://joeljang.github.io/), [Jim Fan](https://jimfan.me/), and [Yuke Zhu](https://yukezhu.me/). I am currently scaling foundation models for general-purpose robots. Previously, I was fortunate to work at [OpenDriveLab](https://opendrivelab.com/) led by [Hongyang Li](https://lihongyang.info/).

## Local Minima

Please find my up-to-date [[Resume]](https://github.com/Little-Podi/Little-Podi/blob/main/gsy_Resume.pdf) to check my current status.

## Region of Interests

- Video World Models for General-Purpose Robots
- Self-Improvement by Scaling Data and Compute

## Selected Checkpoints

- DreamDojo, a Robot World Model pretrained on 44k hours of human egocentric data, showing unprecedented generalization to diverse objects and environments. [[Project](https://dreamdojo-world.github.io/)] [[VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/technology/nvidia-releases-dreamdojo-a-robot-world-model-trained-on-44-000-hours-of)]
- DreamZero, a World Action Model (WAM) that enables zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks and enables few-shot embodiment learning. [[Project](https://dreamzero0.github.io/)]

## Latent Representation

I was born in the last year of the 20th century (May 17th, 2000). I hope to live until the 22nd century so that my life would span three centuries. The Chinese meanings of each word in my name (高深远) are "High", "Deep", "Far", respectively.
