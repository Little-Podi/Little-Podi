## Model Card

I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) and also a research intern affiliated with [GEAR](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/gear/) at [NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/), working with [Scott Reed](https://reedscot.github.io/), [Jim Fan](https://jimfan.me/), and [Yuke Zhu](https://yukezhu.me/). I am currently interested in scaling foundation models for humanoid robots. Previously, I was fortunate to be a member of [OpenDriveLab](https://opendrivelab.com/) led by [Hongyang Li](https://lihongyang.info/).

***I will be on the job market for Mid 2026. Feel free to contact me!***

## Latent Representation

I was born in the last year of the 20th century (May 17th, 2000). I hope to live until the 22nd century so that my life would span three centuries. The Chinese meanings of each word in my name (高深远) are "High", "Deep", "Far", respectively.
